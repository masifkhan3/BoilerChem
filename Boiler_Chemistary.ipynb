        "        \"Boiler chemistry is vital to ensure efficient and safe operation by preventing issues like corrosion, scaling, and excessive buildup of impurities, which can lead to costly repairs and downtime.\",\n",
        "    \"What types of water are typically used in boiler systems?\":\n",
        "        \"The main types of water used are Raw Water, Make-Up Water, Feed Water, and Condensate Return. Each serves a unique purpose, from replacing water losses to maintaining water quality in the system.\",\n",
        "    \"What is the role of 'Make-Up Water' in a boiler system?\":\n",
        "        \"Make-Up Water is added to replace water lost due to steam production and leaks, ensuring the boiler has a consistent water level and proper functionality.\",\n",
        "    \"What does 'water softening' do in boiler treatment?\":\n",
        "        \"Water softening reduces hardness caused by minerals like calcium and magnesium, which can cause scale buildup. This helps to maintain heat transfer efficiency and reduce wear on the boiler.\",\n",
        "    \"Why is deaeration necessary for boiler water?\":\n",
        "        \"Deaeration removes dissolved gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that can lead to corrosion of the boiler's metal parts. This process helps extend the life of the boiler system.\",\n",
        "    \"What are the optimal pH levels for boiler water, and why are they important?\":\n",
        "        \"Boiler water should have a pH between 10 and 12 to prevent corrosion. Maintaining this range minimizes the risk of acidic or alkaline corrosion in the system.\",\n",
        "    \"How does 'Total Dissolved Solids' (TDS) affect boiler performance?\":\n",
        "        \"High TDS can lead to scaling and foaming, which reduce efficiency and cause overheating. Regular blowdowns help control TDS levels within safe limits, ensuring smoother operation.\",\n",
        "    \"Why is monitoring dissolved oxygen important in boiler water?\":\n",
        "        \"Dissolved oxygen should be kept below 7 ppb to avoid corrosion. Excessive oxygen in the boiler can corrode metal surfaces, which can lead to system failures.\",\n",
        "    \"What are some best practices for maintaining good boiler water chemistry?\":\n",
        "        \"Best practices include regular testing and monitoring, routine blowdowns to remove dissolved solids, and proper chemical dosing to maintain balanced pH and reduce impurities.\",\n",
        "    \"How does proper boiler chemistry help improve efficiency?\":\n",
